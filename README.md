# Luhn-algorithm
implementing luhn's algorithm (poorly freestyle implemented) with typescript and soon Go 

no `npm install` is required dont worry

`npm start` or `ts-node main.ts`

and for now you can change the credit card info input manually in the code, by **changing the cc variable in main.ts**
